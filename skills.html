          <p>
            HTML(like most programmers) is the first language I learned. I
            learned most HTML in 2019. I used HTML at my previous position to
            edit and create training programs to make them accabile to all of
            our employees regardless of any disability or language barrier. I
            continue to learn and test myself to make accessible sites and
            programs.

          <img src="/Images/css3-icon.png" alt="CSS3 Icon" />
          <p>
            CSS I found very fun. Creating styles for pages and the new CSS3
            elements have made CSS a very adaptable language even without a
            preprocessor such as SASS. I also originally learned CSS in 2019 and
            then refreshed my skills when I created training programs in my
            previous position.

          <img src="/Images/js-icon.png" alt="JavaScript Icon" />
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very interesting and intuitive language that I began
            learning this year. It is my first true programming language and I
            can see why it has built most of the web today. I truly believe with
            the additions to JavaScript native that it is a powerful tool that
            can be used to build most programs and sites, especially when you
            add things such as react and Node.js.

            alt="Problem-Solving Icon"
          />
          <p>
            Problem Solving is what originally got me into programming and
            development. I love problem solving. At my last position and many
            before, my problem solving skills have helped companies look at
            issues differently and find creative solutions to their problems.

            alt="Project Managment Icon"
          />
          <p>
            Project Management is a very important aspect to development and
            programming that many do not give the respect they should. When I
            start a project, I always break it down to its basic components in
            order to get a full scope of what is required, and make a large
            scale project more feasible for a small team or single person.

          <img src="/Images/figma-icon.png" alt="Figma Icon" />
          <p>
            Figma is a great tool. Even with its free version I can create
            multiple different designs for approval or create styles to easily
            develop a site or software. If you do not know, Figma is a
            collaborative web application for interface design. This opens
            development not just to the programmers but also to everyone on the
            team!

          <img src="/Images/github-icon.png" alt="Github Icon" />
          <p>
            GitHub is the software I currently used for version control of my
            projects and this site! This site is also hosted by Github Pages. In
            using Github I have found it very useful for not only version
            control, but for collaborative efforts such as fixing issues,
            setting milestones, and breaking down large projects into smaller
            more manageable pieces.

          <img src="/Images/communication-icon.png" alt="communication Icon" />
          <p>
            Communication is the most important skill to have in today's
            professional world. Many of the positions I was promoted to in my
            life have been because of my great communication skills. I have a
            talent to break down complicated topics to be explained to a more
            general audience. My communication skill has only grown sense,
            especially when I began training employees at my previous position.

            alt="Customer Service Icon"
          />
          <p>
            Customer Service is a very overlooked skill in programing and
            Software development. However, I believe that customer service is
            very valuable to each member of a team. Respect of our customers
            will develop a better product, documentation, and will create a
            lasting relationship that will benefit all parties involved.

          <p>
            Microsoft Office is a valuable piece of tech that can help a team
            build and communicate projects together. I have extensive experience
            with word, excel, sharepoint, powerapps, and other small
            technologies involved in the Microsoft Office. From creating
            calculators to measure, time and dosage of cannabis to creating in
            person training courses using PowerPoint and PowerApps, there aren't
            many things that Microsoft Office can't do in the hands of a skilled
            employee.
