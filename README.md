    <h1>James (Web Wizard) Randall`s Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
      This is the main space for me to show-off and demonstrate my skills as a
      developer. I am currently a self-taught Web developer/designer. I don't
      have much else to say, but I hope you like it.

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <ul>
      <h3>Update 11</h3>
      <li>The site is now mobile friendly! Using Sass I refactored and recreated my styles to give a more functional and reactive experience for users. I also changed a few colors for accessibility concerns.</li>
      <h3>Update 10</h3>
      <li>Site is live and working well! As you may see a few things have changed. First of all, I will not be doing these updates every commit. Each commit has its own message so I will leave these updates to larger scale updates. Also, the updates have been flipped to have the most recent updates on the top. Finally, I started a new task for my project. I am swapping to SASS in order to fix a few issues and make the site mobile friendly. </li>
      <h3>Update 9</h3>
      <li>Everything is on the site! All content, links and pictures are finished! After this update all I need to do is some testing of my site, then I will be good to go! Site will be launched 2/6/2023!</li>
      <h3>Update 8</h3>
      <li>Html and Css is finished throughout the site. Also, all of the links now work throughout the entire site.Next I will add content, then it will be ready for review and finally publication.</li>
      <h3>Update 7</h3>
      <li>Added html and css to skills. Now I only have one page to go, the contact me, then I will be ready to add content and get this site published!</li>
      <h3>Update 6</h3>
      <li>Finished all properties of the about me, and projects page. I have two more pages to go, then I will add any remaining content, review the rest of the site, then it will be ready for publication. In the effort to save time, the mobile site will be published at a later time. From now on, I will be doing mobile first.</li>
      <h3>Update 5</h3>
      <li>I finished the main page! Not ready for mobile, but I think I will build out the site more before working on that. A few more steps and we will be ready to let the site go live.</li>
      <h3>Update 4</h3>
      <li>Today I added some more pages and gave the site some movement. I also selected the fonts and fixed a few issues they caused.</li>
      <h3>Update 3</h3>
      <li>All positioning and main CSS has been finished on the main page. Finally all I have left is the responsive design on mobile, fonts, text and colors! After that I should be ready to build the rest of the site out. </li><h3>Update 2</h3>
      <li>CSS Created for the header, nav, and about me! I still need to choose a font and do some small level tweaking but I love how this is turning out!</li><h3>Update 1</h3>
      <li><code>develop</code> branch created! Time to get to work!</li>      
    </ul>
