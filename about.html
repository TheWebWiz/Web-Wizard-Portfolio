          <h3>A little more about me...</h3>
          <p>
            My Computer Science journey started in 2019. Originally I was
            wanting to become a gaming developer. I ended up moving to northern
            Ohio for more job prospects in the field I wanted to work in and I
            met a girl, what can I say. Once I was settled, I eventually was
            hired by a small cannabis start up in Huron, Ohio. Although I was
            still learning coding, it began to take the back seat to the new
            work I was doing in the cannabis business. I soon became the safety
            coordinator of the company, mainly because of my past in
            construction safety, and my programming education had officially
            taken a rest. In 2021, I became the company's main safety and
            training specialist. This finally gave me an avenue to learn web
            development and programming again to create structured training
            courses and classes for my fellow employees to take. I needed to
            know basic HTML and CSS to perfect the look and feel of my courses.
            I used my previous education plus the MDN documentation to create
            truly unique and highly functional courses.<br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, I was laid off in Dec 2022, but this did give me the
            time to fully resume my education path. I am currently learning to
            become a software engineer with a heavy focus on JavaScript. I am
            very fluent in HTML, CSS, and at basic Javascript, and have at put
            my hands on many different techs and libraries such as SASS, GitHub,
            React, Node.js, and more! If you have any questions please email me
            via the contact button or for more info please see my LinkedIn, and
            Github profiles. Thank You.
